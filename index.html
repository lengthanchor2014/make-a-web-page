                           <p> 

                                The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. 
                                When a person goes to a web page like <b><a href = "www.google.com">www.google.com</a></b>, their computer 
                                sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate 
                                HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web 
                                browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. 
                                This <a href = "https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">video</a> does a good job of explaining the concept.

                          <div class="concept"> HTML </div>

                                  <em>HTML</em> - stands for Hypertext Marup Language

                                    HTML documents form 
                                    the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain 
                                    text content which describes "what you see" and markup which 
                                    describes "how it looks". 

                                   This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">
                                   video</a> gives a good overview.

                             <p>

                                    HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, 
                                    we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.

                                    This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">video</a>
                                      explains the distinction well.

                             <p> 

                                    Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. 
                                    This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer 
                                    can cause huge problems.
                            </p>
                          <div class="concept"> Inline vs Block Elements </div>
                            <p> 
                              HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
                            </p>

 <!-- Lesson 2 Concepts -->
                 <h2 id ="lesson-2"> Lesson 2: Creating Structured Document with HTML </h2>
                 <div class="concept"> Developer Tools </div>
                           <p> 
                             HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
                          </p>
                 <div class="concept"> HTML's "tree-like" Structure </div>
                             <p> 
                                       The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
                                       In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...
                            </p>
                 <div class="concept"> Indentations and Boxes </div>
                             <p> 
                                  When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.
                          </p>
                <div class="concept"> Text Editors </div>
                             <p> 
                                    When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.
                             </p>

            <div class="concept"> Avoiding Repetition </div>
                           <p>
          Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.
        </p>
        <p>
          TIP: Avoid repition and it will help you make good code

              <div class="concept"> CSS </div>
                             <p> 
                                     CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <b>class</b> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
                             </p>

                  <p>
                      All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

                      The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around HTML elements, and it consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

                      The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.
